"# MAX2769FT2232H" 
This design was created to provide a hands-on platform for exploring GPS signal processing. When assembled according to the default configuration, and flased with the appropriate FT_PROG file (L1IFStream.xml), the card should stream GPS IF data out the serial port. The jumper configuration selects among three different settings. It is recommended to start with the default configuration before configuring for software controlled configuration.
