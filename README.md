"# MAX2769FT2232H" 
This design was created to provide a hands-on platform for exploring GPS signal processing. When assembled according to the default configuration, and flashed with the appropriate FT_PROG file (L1IFStream.xml), the card should stream GPS IF data out of the USB port. The jumper configuration is selected among three different settings. It is recommended to start with the default configuration before configuring for software-controlled configuration.

This design was created because this one: https://pdfserv.maximintegrated.com/en/an/AN4275.pdf was never made available.
